Welcome to the Sports Team and School Club Registration App, a convenient registration platform designed for sports teams and school clubs/groups. This application streamlines the registration process, making it easy for users to join their chosen organization, select their desired team or club, and complete the registration form. If time allows or in a future class, administrators can also manage registrations efficiently.

## Getting Started

To get started with the registration process, follow these simple steps:

1. **Select Your Organization**:
   - Click the drop-down menu and choose your specific organization. This step helps us tailor the registration process to your group.

2. **Choose Your Team or Club**:
   - After selecting your organization, you'll see a list of available sports teams or school clubs associated with your chosen organization.
   - Pick the team or club that you wish to register for.

3. **Complete the Registration Form**:
   - Once you've selected your team or club, you'll be directed to a multi-page registration form.
   - Fill out the form with your personal information. We aim to gather the details we need efficiently.

4. **Submit Your Registration**:
   - After providing all the required information, click the "Submit" button to complete your registration. Your registration will be sent to the organization's administrators for review (mockup).
