# javascriptproject

In a nutshell, it's a registration app for a team or a club or whatever you want to register people for.  You'd choose the organization, then the specific team (if there are multiple options in that org), then fill out a form of your info, and then some admin would be able to potentially see all the registrations and decide if they qualify for the team/club/etc and assign them or decline them.

Division of labor would be 1-2 people working on front end, 1-2 people working on the javascript functions.
